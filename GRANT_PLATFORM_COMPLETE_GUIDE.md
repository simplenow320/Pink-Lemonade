# 🎯 Pink Lemonade Grant Platform - Complete System Guide

## What This Platform Does (In Simple Terms)

Think of Pink Lemonade as your organization's **AI-powered grant assistant** that:
1. **Finds grants** that match what your nonprofit does
2. **Scores them** to show which ones you're most likely to win
3. **Writes proposals** using AI that sounds like a $1000/hour consultant
4. **Tracks everything** through an 8-stage workflow from discovery to reporting

It's like having a full grant-writing team working 24/7, but at a fraction of the cost ($79-499/month vs. hiring consultants at $5,000-25,000 per grant).
