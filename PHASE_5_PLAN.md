# PHASE 5: IMPACT REPORTING & DATA COLLECTION
**Purpose**: Help organizations with the hard work of grant reporting through manual reporting and QR-based participant data collection

## Overview
Phase 5 delivers comprehensive grant reporting capabilities with two-facing approach:
1. **Organization-Facing**: Manual grant reporting for any grant (platform or external)
2. **Participant-Facing**: QR code-based impact data collection from program beneficiaries

## Core Components

### 1. Grant Reporting Dashboard
- Support for both platform grants and manually uploaded grants
- Quarterly/annual reporting workflows
- Progress tracking against grant objectives
- Document upload for supporting evidence
- Report generation and submission

### 2. QR Code Impact Collection
- Generate unique QR codes for each program/grant
- Mobile-optimized participant survey interface
- Real-time data collection and validation
- Automatic aggregation for reports

### 3. Participant Survey Structure
**Basic Information:**
- Name
- Age
- Location
- Program enrolled

**Impact Questions (5):**
1. How has this program helped you?
2. What specific changes have you experienced?
3. Rate the program's impact on your life (1-10)
4. Would you recommend this program to others?
5. What was the most valuable part of the program?

**Improvement Questions (2):**
1. How could this program better serve your needs?
2. Who else in your community could benefit from this program?
