### Growth Phase (6-18 months):
1. **Negotiate Candid volume discount** at 500+ users
2. **Add premium data sources** for Enterprise/Platinum
3. **Implement smart caching** to reduce API calls

### Scale Phase (18+ months):
1. **Custom enterprise hosting** for large customers
2. **White-label infrastructure** costs
3. **International data sources** for global expansion

## PRICING OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Current Sweet Spots:
- **Professional tier** has 97.9% margin - room for features
- **Enterprise tier** could support premium data add-ons
- **All tiers** profitable from day 1

### Potential Adjustments:
- Add "AI Writing Unlimited" upgrade: +$99/month (95% margin)

- White-label setup fee: $5,000 one-time (98% margin)

## CONCLUSION

**Key Findings:**
- **Extremely healthy margins**: 87-99% across all tiers
- **Cost per user decreases** with scale (economies of scale)
- **Break-even at just 15 customers** 
- **$10K Candid cost** represents only 0.4% of revenue at $2.5M ARR

**Your tech cost structure is exceptionally strong** due to:
1. Free government data sources
2. Efficient cloud infrastructure  
3. High-value pricing tiers
4. Scalable architecture

**Bottom Line**: Your raw tech cost per user ranges from $4.88-12.87/month depending on scale, giving you 87-99% gross margins - among the highest in SaaS. The $10K Candid cost becomes negligible at scale and provides massive competitive advantage through premium data access.
