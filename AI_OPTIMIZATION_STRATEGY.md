### CURRENT COSTS (All GPT-4o)
**Average per user per month**: $4.20
- Grant matching: 50K tokens × $10/1M = $0.50
- AI writing: 200K tokens × $10/1M = $2.00  
- Analysis: 30K tokens × $10/1M = $0.30
- Misc tasks: 140K tokens × $10/1M = $1.40

### OPTIMIZED COSTS (70% GPT-3.5, 30% GPT-4o)
**Average per user per month**: $1.68 (60% reduction)

**GPT-3.5-turbo (70% of tasks)**:
- Grant matching: 50K tokens × $1/1M = $0.05
- Data processing: 140K tokens × $1/1M = $0.14
- Quick summaries: 100K tokens × $1/1M = $0.10
- **Subtotal**: $0.29

**GPT-4o (30% of tasks)**:
- Complex writing: 200K tokens × $10/1M = $2.00
- Strategic analysis: 80K tokens × $10/1M = $0.80
- **Subtotal**: $2.80

**TOTAL OPTIMIZED**: $1.68/user/month
**SAVINGS**: $2.52/user/month (60% reduction)

### ANNUAL SAVINGS PROJECTION

| Users | Current Cost | Optimized Cost | Annual Savings |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| 100 | $5,040 | $2,016 | $3,024 |
| 500 | $25,200 | $10,080 | $15,120 |
