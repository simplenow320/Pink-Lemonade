# Case for Support & Impact Reporting: What You Have vs What You Need

## 📊 Quick Status Overview

### ✅ CASE FOR SUPPORT

**What's Working Now:**
```
✅ Basic AI generation           → Works, but expensive ($0.50-$1.50 each)
✅ 9 comprehensive sections      → Executive summary, problem, solution, impact, etc.
✅ PDF export                    → Can download as PDF
✅ Database storage              → Saves your documents
✅ API endpoint ready            → /api/smart-tools/case/generate
```

**What's Missing for Consultant Quality:**
```
❌ Hybrid templates              → No cost savings (still 100% expensive AI)
❌ Professional formatting       → Plain text, not consultant-grade design
❌ Multiple export formats       → Only PDF, need Word, PowerPoint, etc.
❌ Visual components             → No charts, infographics, timelines
❌ Donor customization           → One-size-fits-all, not persona-specific
❌ Branded layouts               → Generic, not professional design
```

**Bottom Line:** You CAN generate case statements, but they're expensive and don't look consultant-quality.

### ✅ DUAL-FACING IMPACT REPORTING

**What's Working Now:**

**Beneficiary Side (Data Collection):**
```

✅ Basic analytics               → Calculate satisfaction, improvement
✅ API endpoints                 → /api/impact-qr/create-survey
```

**Funder Side (Reports):**
```
✅ AI report generation          → Works, but expensive ($0.60-$1.20 each)
✅ Metrics aggregation           → Pulls data from surveys
✅ Story extraction              → Gets impact stories
✅ PDF export                    → Can download reports
✅ API endpoint                  → /api/smart-tools/impact/generate
```

**What's Missing for Consultant Quality:**

**Beneficiary Side:**
```
❌ Mobile-optimized design       → Works but not phone-friendly
❌ Offline capability            → Must have internet
❌ Photo/video upload            → Text only, no visual proof
❌ Multi-language                → English only
❌ Accessibility features        → Not WCAG compliant
❌ SMS/WhatsApp integration      → Web-only, no SMS option
```

**Funder Side:**
```
❌ Consultant-grade templates    → Plain format, not professional
❌ Data visualizations           → No charts, graphs, dashboards
❌ Interactive reports           → Static PDF only
❌ Comparison analytics          → No year-over-year, program comparisons
❌ Branded formatting            → Generic, not polished
❌ Multi-format export           → PDF only, need PowerPoint, etc.
❌ Hybrid cost optimization      → Still expensive ($0.60+ per report)
```

**Bottom Line:** You CAN collect impact data and generate reports, but they're expensive and don't look professional enough for major funders.
