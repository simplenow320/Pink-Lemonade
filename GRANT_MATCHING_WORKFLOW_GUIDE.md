# How Grant Matching Works - Simple Guide

## What This System Does

This grant management platform helps you find grants that match your organization. Think of it like a dating app for nonprofits and grants - it looks at what your organization does and finds grants that might be a good fit.

## The Basic Workflow

### 1. You Tell Us About Your Organization
- What your mission is (helping kids, fighting poverty, etc.)
- Where you're located
- What programs you run
- How much funding you typically need

### 2. We Find Grants For You
The system looks through hundreds of grants and picks ones that might work for your organization. It's like having someone read through piles of grant announcements and only showing you the relevant ones.

### 3. We Score Each Match
Every grant gets a score from 1 to 5:
- **5 = Excellent Match** - This grant is perfect for you
- **4 = Very Good Match** - Strong fit, worth applying  
- **3 = Good Match** - Decent fit, consider applying
- **2 = Fair Match** - Might work but not ideal
- **1 = Poor Match** - Probably not worth your time

## What You See on Each Grant Card

## How the Matching Actually Works

### Step 1: We Analyze Your Profile
The system looks at:
- Keywords from your mission statement
- Your location and service area  
- Types of programs you run
- Your organization size and budget

### Step 2: We Compare to Each Grant
For every grant, we check:
- Does the purpose match what you do?
- Are you in the right location?
- Is your organization the right size?
- Do you meet the eligibility requirements?

### Step 3: We Use AI to Score the Match
Our AI system reads both your profile and the grant details, then gives a smart score based on:
- How well your mission aligns with their priorities
- Whether you meet all their requirements
- How competitive the grant likely is
- Your organization's strengths for this specific opportunity

### Step 4: We Add Historical Intelligence
For grants where we have data, we also:
- Look at the funder's past giving patterns
- Analyze what types of organizations they prefer
- Predict your chances of success
- Suggest the best approach for applying
