- Smart deadline calculations
- Team collaboration support
- Activity logging and tracking

### 2. API Endpoints ✅
**File**: `app/api/phase2_workflow.py`
```
/api/phase2/application/create         - Create application from opportunity
/api/phase2/application/<id>/stage     - Update workflow stage
/api/phase2/applications/staged        - Get pipeline view
/api/phase2/deadlines                  - Get upcoming deadlines
/api/phase2/reminders                  - Get smart reminders
/api/phase2/application/<id>/team      - Add team members
/api/phase2/application/<id>/checklist - Manage checklist
/api/phase2/workflow/stats            - Get workflow analytics
```

### 3. Database Schema Updates ✅
**Updated Model**: `Grant` in `app/models.py`
- Added workflow tracking fields
- Team collaboration support
- Activity logging
- Checklist management
- Priority and stage tracking

### 4. UI Components ✅
**File**: `client/src/components/Phase2WorkflowDisplay.jsx`

6. **Pending** ⏰ - Awaiting funder decision
7. **Awarded** 🏆 - Grant awarded
8. **Rejected** ❌ - Application not funded

## Priority System

- **Urgent** (Red): Deadlines within 7 days
- **High** (Orange): Deadlines within 14 days
- **Medium** (Blue): Deadlines within 30 days
- **Low** (Green): Deadlines beyond 30 days
