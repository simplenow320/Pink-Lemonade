- **78 API files** (massive API surface)
- **4 "not implemented" endpoints** found
- **4 endpoints returning 501 errors**

**Key Problem**: `app/api/ai.py` - Basic AI endpoints return "not implemented":
```python
@bp.route('/match', methods=['POST'])
def get_match_score():
    return jsonify({"message": "AI matching not implemented"}), 501
```

**But**: Advanced AI endpoints like `ai_matching.py`, `smart_tools.py` ARE implemented and working.

**Assessment**: Inconsistent integration - sophisticated backends exist but not all connected to frontend routes.

#### Database Models - COMPREHENSIVE
**Status**: Extensive data modeling completed
- **User authentication models** (with progress tracking)
- **Grant and organization models** with extended profiles
- **Analytics and workflow tracking** models
- **Team collaboration** structures
- **Payment and subscription** models

**Assessment**: Data architecture is solid and comprehensive.

### üé® **Frontend Integration - UNKNOWN**
**Observation**: Flask app serves React from `client/build/` but React codebase not examined.
**Risk**: Advanced AI services may not be connected to user interface.
