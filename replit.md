# GrantFlow

## Overview

Pink Lemonade (formerly GrantFlow) is a comprehensive AI-powered grant management platform designed specifically for nonprofit organizations. The system helps nonprofits discover, evaluate, track, and apply for grants through intelligent web scraping, AI-powered matching, and automated narrative generation. Built with a focus on urban ministries and faith-based organizations, Pink Lemonade streamlines the entire grant lifecycle from discovery to application submission.

The platform leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o for intelligent grant analysis, match scoring, and proposal writing assistance. It features automated grant discovery through web scraping, real-time analytics, and a complete grant management dashboard with status tracking from initial discovery through final decision. The system maintains strict Pink Lemonade branding (pink, white, black, grey only) with single logo placement.
