We are REBUILDING from the existing project structure — do NOT start a new repo.

Task:
Create a “Fundraising CRM Dashboard” as the main landing page after login:
- Central hub for grant tracking, KPIs, and quick actions.
- MUST feature uploaded logo (provided later) prominently in the hero area ONLY — never duplicated elsewhere.
- Style: minimalist, clean, modern muted matte look.

Sections:
1) **Hero / Welcome**
   - Large prominent uploaded logo in center-left hero area.
   - Text greeting with org name (from user profile).
   - Subtitle: “Your fundraising command center — track, discover, and win grants.”
   - “Add New Grant” quick button.
   - “View Opportunities” quick button.

2) **Key Metrics Row**
   - Cards showing:
     - Total Grants in Pipeline
     - Total Funds Applied For
     - Total Funds Won
     - Win Rate %
   - Each card clickable → filters Grants table by relevant status.

3) **Recent Activity Feed**
   - Scrollable list of:
     - Grants added/updated
     - Deadlines approaching
     - Notes/comments
   - Show 5 most recent items with timestamps.

4) **Watchlist Overview**
   - Small panel listing current watchlists + number of new opportunities found since last login.
   - “Manage Watchlists” link.

5) **Saved Grants Snapshot**
   - Table preview of top 5 grants by nearest deadline.
   - Columns: Title, Funder, Amount, Status, Deadline.
   - “View All” button → full Saved Grants page.

Routing & Navigation:
- Dashboard is default post-login route (/dashboard).
- Nav bar includes: Dashboard, Opportunities, Watchlists, Saved Grants, Reports, Settings.
- Nav styling follows muted matte palette — highlight active tab.

Backend:
- Create /api/dashboard/metrics endpoint to return KPI data.
- Create /api/dashboard/recent-activity to return latest updates.
- Use existing Grants + Watchlists collections for data.
- Cache metrics for faster load.

Testing / Debug / Verify (MANDATORY):
1) TEST:
   - Verify dashboard loads with mock + live data.
   - Metrics match underlying grants data.
   - Recent activity updates in real-time or on refresh.
   - Logo loads in hero area only.
2) DEBUG:
   - Fix missing metrics, UI misalignment, and data fetch delays.
   - Resolve any null values in KPI cards.
3) VERIFY:
   - Minimalist matte look is applied consistently.
   - Logo is not duplicated in nav bar or elsewhere.
   - All buttons route correctly.
   - Dashboard responsive on mobile/tablet.
   - Provide one-paragraph summary of files added/changed and where to adjust KPI logic.

Deliverables:
- Fully functional Fundraising CRM Dashboard.
- Live metrics and activity feed.
- Logo placement rules respected.
- Documentation: web/docs/dashboard.md explaining each section, how KPIs are calculated, and how to adjust dashboard layout.
