We are REBUILDING from the existing project structure — do NOT start a new repo.

Task:
Create a new dashboard view that:
- Matches the minimalist, clean, modern, muted matte design established on the landing page.
- Uses the same color palette, typography, and spacing for a cohesive brand experience.
- Avoids duplication of logo or project name (logo should ONLY appear in the top-left navigation bar once).
- Is responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Contains placeholder widgets and sections that will later connect to APIs for:
    1. Grants & Funding Opportunities Feed
    2. Foundation Directory by City (Grand Rapids, Charlotte, Atlanta, Detroit, Indiana)
    3. Application Deadlines & Reminders
    4. Saved/Bookmarked Grants
    5. AI Recommendation Panel (personalized funding suggestions)

Functionality Requirements:
- Each placeholder must have a clear `data-source` attribute in the HTML/JS so API endpoints can be swapped in without code restructuring.
- Include mock data examples in JSON format for each placeholder so layout can be previewed before API integration.
- Add a collapsible left-side navigation menu with links to:
    - Dashboard (active)
    - Grants Feed
    - Saved Opportunities
    - My Applications
    - Settings
- Ensure top bar includes:
    - Welcome message with the user’s name (placeholder variable: `{{username}}`)
    - Notifications icon
    - User profile dropdown
- All text and labels must be editable from a single config file (`dashboard-config.json`).

Technical Steps:
1. Insert dashboard code into the appropriate location in the existing structure.
2. Maintain routing consistency and avoid breaking navigation from the landing page.
3. Write `dashboard-notes.md` explaining:
    - File paths for each section
    - How to update text
    - How to swap mock data for live APIs
4. After completing the build:
    - TEST the dashboard in desktop and mobile views for layout consistency.
    - DEBUG any console errors or broken styles.
    - VERIFY:
        - All placeholders are present and labeled
        - Navigation works correctly
        - No duplication of logo or brand name
        - Config file edits update text sitewide

Goal:
Produce a functional, API-ready dashboard skeleton that looks polished and requires zero manual restructuring when APIs are integrated later.
