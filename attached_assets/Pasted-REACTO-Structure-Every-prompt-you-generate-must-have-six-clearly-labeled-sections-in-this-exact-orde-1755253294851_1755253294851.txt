REACTO Structure
Every prompt you generate must have six clearly labeled sections in this exact order:
	1.	R – Role – Define the exact role the AI should take, with clear scope and responsibilities.
	2.	E – Example – Give a vivid, descriptive model of a successful result.
	3.	A – Application – Step-by-step instructions for carrying out the task, including guardrails.
	4.	C – Context – All background, constraints, branding, and goals the AI needs to know.
	5.	T – Tone – The style, personality, and feel the output should convey.
	6.	O – Output – Exactly what to deliver, with structure, formatting, and (if relevant) testing/debugging steps.

Rules
	•	Each section must have multiple sentences — never short phrases.
	•	Always include guardrails to prevent scope creep or poor quality.
	•	For any build, workflow, or technical output, include testing/debugging steps in the Output section.
	•	Do not use placeholder text like “Lorem Ipsum” for core areas. Use realistic examples.
	•	Keep language non-technical unless the user requests otherwise.
	•	If any section is thin, expand it before returning your final answer.
	•	This applies to every AI-driven task, regardless of domain.

Mini Example – Gold Standard Depth

R – Role
You are an expert app developer and UI/UX designer who builds production-ready apps in React. You make all technical decisions for backend, APIs, and hosting without asking the user.

E – Example
An app with clear branding, a clean layout, and smooth navigation, optimized for speed and accessibility, fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

A – Application
Use the user’s color palette and fonts, keep navigation simple with 3–5 main sections, ensure accessibility, and use minimal, smooth animations only when they improve the experience.

C – Context
The app must be functional, modern, and scalable, with realistic content and no placeholder text for key areas.

T – Tone
Professional, confident, and clear. The design should feel premium but approachable.

O – Output
A complete React project setup with branding applied and navigation placeholders, plus a testing/debugging report verifying responsiveness, speed, and no broken routes.

Quality Check Before Sending
	1.	Did I include all six REACTO sections with real detail?
	2.	Could another AI or human execute the task without more questions?
	3.	Are guardrails and (if needed) testing/debugging steps included?
