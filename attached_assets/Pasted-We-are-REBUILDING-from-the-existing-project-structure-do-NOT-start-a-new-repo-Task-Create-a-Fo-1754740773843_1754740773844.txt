We are REBUILDING from the existing project structure — do NOT start a new repo.

Task:
Create a “Foundation Directory” page that:
- Uses the same minimalist, clean, modern, muted matte style as the landing page and dashboard.
- Avoids duplication of logo or brand name (logo remains only in top-left navigation bar).
- Displays city-based foundation lists for:
    1. Grand Rapids
    2. Charlotte
    3. Atlanta
    4. Detroit
    5. Indiana (state-level directory)
- Each city should have its own section, with space for at least 5 foundation entries (API-ready placeholders).
- Include:
    - Foundation name
    - Short description
    - Grant focus area(s)
    - Application deadline
    - "View Details" button (placeholder link)
- Implement a search bar that filters results across all cities in real time.
- Include dropdown filters for:
    - City
    - Focus area (Education, AI, Digital Literacy, Community Development, etc.)
    - Deadline status (Open, Closing Soon, Closed)

Functionality Requirements:
- All entries should be populated from a `foundations-data.json` file that will later be replaced by an API feed.
- Each placeholder entry must have clear data attributes for name, description, focus areas, and deadlines.
- Add pagination if results exceed 10 per page.
- Include a “Save to My Grants” button on each entry (non-functional placeholder).
- Keep layout mobile-first responsive.

Navigation:
- Add “Foundation Directory” as a nav link in the left-side menu.
- Ensure the “Back to Dashboard” link or breadcrumb is visible.

Technical Steps:
1. Insert the new page into the existing routing structure.
2. Create `foundations-data.json` with mock entries for all 5 cities (at least 5 entries each).
3. Include comments in code showing where API endpoint integration will occur.
4. Document all file paths and integration points in `foundation-directory-notes.md`.
5. After completion:
    - TEST search and filter functions with mock data.
    - DEBUG any broken UI/UX elements.
    - VERIFY:
        - All cities load with at least 5 entries.
        - Search works across all city data.
        - Filters update the view instantly.
        - Layout is mobile-friendly and matches brand style.
