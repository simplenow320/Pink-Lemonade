We are REBUILDING in the existing repo. Do NOT start a new repo.

Goal
Run an end-to-end test and verification for Prompts 1–7, ensuring:
1) All functionality works as intended.
2) The app adheres 100% to our branding guidelines.
3) No placeholder data is passed off as real.
4) No duplicate logos or brand names appear in the UI.

Branding Guidelines (MANDATORY)
- Primary palette: Matte pink, white, grey, black
- No additional or random colors allowed
- Matte finishes only — no glossy gradients or neon tones
- Use exact logo file provided by me; do NOT regenerate or alter it
- Logo appears once in hero section only; not in nav, sidebar, or repeated on pages

Scope to Verify
1) Landing page with hero logo, pain-point copy, and correct colors
2) Dashboard with KPIs and activity that respect branding
3) Foundation Directory with search, filters, and correct branding
4) Saved Grants and My Applications CRUD with branded UI elements
5) Discovery Connectors with daily schedule and Run Now actions
6) Watchlists by city
7) API and Data Integration Layer

Branding Checks
1) Every UI element (buttons, cards, backgrounds, borders, text) uses only matte pink, white, grey, or black
2) No inline styles or random color hex codes outside brand palette
3) Global theme tokens are set once and applied consistently
4) Components match minimalist, clean, modern, muted look

Add a test harness
1) Create /web/tests/run-tests.ts using Playwright or Puppeteer
2) Include brand palette test: scan DOM for colors outside approved list and fail if found
3) Add npm scripts in package.json for "test:e2e", "lint", and "typecheck"

Create mode indicators
1) APP_DATA_MODE=LIVE or MOCK
2) Footer badge shows LIVE when calling real endpoints or DEMO when in mock mode

Landing Page Tests
1) Logo placement in hero only
2) Branding palette check passes
3) Headline, subheadline, CTA buttons load correctly

Dashboard Tests
1) KPIs are real in LIVE mode or "N/A" in mock mode
2) Branding check passes
3) No placeholder numbers without DEMO badge

Directory, Grants, Connectors, Watchlists Tests
(As previously described in Prompts 1–7, now with branding compliance checks included for every component)

API Layer Tests
1) All API calls go through central API Manager
2) No hardcoded secrets
3) LIVE vs MOCK mode respected

Acceptance Criteria
1) TEST_REPORT.md lists PASS, FAIL, or SKIPPED for each branding and functional check
2) No unapproved colors appear anywhere in code or DOM
3) All lint and type checks pass
4) All brand rules are enforced globally
5) No duplicate logos or brand names outside allowed location

Run Sequence
1) Test in MOCK mode, fix issues
2) Test in LIVE mode, fix issues
3) Verify branding compliance in both modes
4) Deliver final TEST_REPORT.md with any failing branding checks flagged in **red**
