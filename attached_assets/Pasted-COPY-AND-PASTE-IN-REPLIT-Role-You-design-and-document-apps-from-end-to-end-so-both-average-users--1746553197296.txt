App Description
Clario is a modern, minimalist coaching and consulting assistant that captures voice conversations, transcribes them using advanced AI, and automatically extracts actionable items. It helps coaches, consultants, and mentors focus on their clients rather than administrative tasks by intelligently organizing discussion points, goals, and action items with personalized outputs based on user preferences.

Summary (6 sentences)
This flow takes you from signing up all the way through getting a polished, editable report packed with real insight—in your own voice. You start by setting up your profile, integrations, and any custom fields so the AI knows exactly how you talk and what matters most. Recording is as simple as tapping a button, and behind the scenes we stitch your audio into a file, securely upload it, and turn it into a clean transcript. Our AI then reads that transcript, pulls out a thoughtful summary (5–8 sentences), action items, due dates, and your custom-field values, all phrased in the tone you chose at setup. You get to review and tweak every bit of that output before it’s saved, ensuring it truly sounds like you. Finally, you can view the report on screen, export it via email, Word, or PDF, and jump straight into action.
