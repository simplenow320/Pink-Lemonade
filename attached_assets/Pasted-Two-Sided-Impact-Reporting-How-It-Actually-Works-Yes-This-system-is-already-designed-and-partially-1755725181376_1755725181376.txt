Two-Sided Impact Reporting: How It Actually Works
Yes! This system is already designed and partially built in your platform. Let me show you the complete flow:

ORGANIZATION SIDE (Admin Dashboard)
STEP 1: CREATE PROGRAM SURVEYS
What Org Does: Clicks "Impact Measurement" tool and picks a program
Behind the Scenes: AI Survey Builder creates custom questions for that specific program:

"How has this after-school program helped you?"
"Rate your confidence level before vs after"
"What skills did you learn?"
Org Sees: Professional survey tailored to their program goals
STEP 2: GENERATE UNIQUE LINKS & QR CODES
What Org Does: Clicks "Share Survey" button
Behind the Scenes: System creates unique tracking links like:

yourplatform.com/survey/abc123?program=afterschool
yourplatform.com/survey/abc123?program=jobtraining
QR codes generated for each program
Org Sees: Printable QR codes and shareable links for each program
STEP 3: DISTRIBUTE TO PARTICIPANTS
What Org Does: Prints QR codes, shares links, or sends via text/email
Behind the Scenes: Each link tracks which program and which distribution method
Participants See: Simple mobile-friendly survey that asks "Which program are you reporting on?" then shows relevant questions

PARTICIPANT SIDE (Ground Level)
STEP 4: PARTICIPANTS RESPOND
What Participant Does: Scans QR code or clicks link on their phone
Behind the Scenes:

Mobile-optimized survey loads
Participant selects their program from dropdown
AI asks program-specific questions
Responses stored with program tags
Participant Sees: Simple questions like "How did this program help you?" with easy mobile answers
STEP 5: REAL-TIME DATA VALIDATION
What Happens: As soon as participant submits
Behind the Scenes: AI instantly:

Checks response quality (1-10 score)
Flags suspicious or duplicate responses
Analyzes sentiment and key themes
Categorizes feedback by impact type
System Stores: Clean, validated program-specific data
BACK TO ORGANIZATION SIDE
STEP 6: AI GENERATES IMPACT REPORTS
What Org Does: Clicks "Generate Impact Report"
Behind the Scenes: AI combines all participant responses to create:

Program success metrics
Participant story quotes
Before/after comparisons
Charts showing impact trends
Org Sees: Professional impact report ready for funders
THE COMPLETE FLOW SUMMARY
Org creates program-specific surveys (AI questions)
System generates unique QR codes/links (trackable by program)
Participants scan codes and select programs (mobile-friendly)
Responses stored and validated in real-time (AI quality checks)
AI transforms data into professional reports (funder-ready)
CURRENT STATUS
âœ… Already Built: Survey system, AI question generation, response storage, data validation, impact report generation

ðŸ”¨ Needs Building: QR code generation, unique URL creation, program selection dropdown

Bottom Line: The hard part (AI analysis, data storage, report generation) is done. You just need the QR codes and program selection interface to complete the two-sided system.

This is exactly what you described - participants report through unique links, data gets stored by program, and AI uses it for impact reporting!
